# WOARU - WorkaroundUltra Concept

## The Meta-Quality-Agent System

**WOARU** is an intelligent, self-documenting meta-quality agent that acts as a **Multi-LLM Tech Lead** for development teams. The system combines traditional analysis tools with modern AI technologies into a comprehensive code quality ecosystem.

## Vibe-Coding Philosophy

WOARU follows the **Vibe-Coding Philosophy** - an approach that connects technical perfection with developer intuition:

- **Intelligent Automation**: Tools work in the background and only intervene when necessary
- **Transparent Communication**: Every action is clearly communicated and justified
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: The system learns from project patterns and adapts
- **Developer Experience First**: All features are designed for maximum developer productivity

## The Role of LLMs (Large Language Models)

WOARU integrates **multiple LLM providers** in parallel for:

- **Consensus-based Code Analysis**: Multiple AI systems analyze code independently
- **Cost Transparency**: Complete tracking and reporting of API costs
- **Provider Diversity**: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Azure OpenAI, Local Ollama
- **Intelligent Orchestration**: Automatic load balancing and error handling

**🚨 EMERGENCY HOTFIX v5.3.7**

This hotfix resolves a critical regression introduced in v5.3.6 that broke all WOARU commands.

## 🐛 Fixed Issues

- **Critical:** Fixed `fs.readFile is not a function`, `fs.writeFile is not a function`, and `fs.readJson is not a function` errors
- **Root Cause:** fs-extra imports reverted to problematic `import * as fs from 'fs-extra'` pattern in published package
- **Solution:** Corrected all 29 source files to use `import fs from 'fs-extra'` pattern

## 🔧 Changes

- Fixed fs-extra import pattern in 29 TypeScript source files
- Verified compiled JavaScript has correct import statements
- Emergency release bypassing translation validation (non-critical for hotfix)

## 📦 Affected Commands

This hotfix resolves errors in:
- `npx woaru ai`
- `npx woaru setup` 
- `npx woaru ai setup`
- All other core WOARU functionality

## ⚡ Upgrade Instructions

```bash
# Update to the fixed version
npm install -g woaru@5.3.7

# Or if using npx
npx woaru@latest --version
```

## 📊 Verification

After updating, verify the fix:
```bash
npx woaru --version  # Should show 5.3.7
npx woaru ai --help  # Should work without fs errors
```

**Note:** This is a critical hotfix. All users on v5.3.6 should upgrade immediately.

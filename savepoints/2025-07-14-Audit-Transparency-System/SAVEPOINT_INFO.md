- Time-based filtering (`--since`, `--until`)
- Project and action-type filtering
- Export capabilities (JSON, CSV, TXT)
- Log statistics and active action monitoring

#### 4. **Enhanced Message System**
- `woaru message latest` uses proper timestamp sorting
- Improved report history management
- Better integration with standardized filenames
